    "# **Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to classify medical images, specifically using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Document your process and findings in a detailed report.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset**: Use the PneumoniaMNIST dataset.\n",
    "* **Preprocessing**: There is no need for additional preprocessing as the dataset is already processed.\n",
    "* **Code and Resources**: All required code for loading, training, and evaluating the model is available on the MedMNIST GitHub Repository. Refer to the following resources:\n",
    "  * [Getting Started Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MedMNIST/MedMNIST/blob/main/examples/getting_started.ipynb) for a toy example.\n",
    "  * [Experiments Repository](https://github.com/MedMNIST/experiments) for full-fledged training of ResNet18 and ResNet50. Use ResNet18 for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Environment**: Use Google Colab for implementation. Ensure to mount your Google Drive using:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    from google.colab import drive\n",
    "    drive.mount('/gdrive')\n",
    "```\n",
    "And change the runtime to GPU for efficient training.\n",
    "# Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "Use the **PneumoniaMNIST** dataset, which requires no additional preprocessing.\n",
    "2. **Model Training**:\n",
    "Implement and train a ResNet18 model using the provided resources and examples. You can choose to either train from scratch or use transfer learning with preloaded weights. \n",
    "* If you choose training from scratch, you should try to experiment with different learning rates to try to improve your result.\n",
    "* If you choose transfer learning, you should try to experiment with freezing different layers. \n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "Evaluate the model's performance using the test set.\n",
    "Generate and analyze a confusion matrix and ROC curve.\n",
    "4. **Explainability with SHAP**\n",
    "* Apply SHAP for global and local explanations of the model.\n",
    "* Analyze at least two test cases with correct and incorrect predictions, from different classes.\n",
    "* Use Gradient Explainer for image classification. You can find examples on how to apply it in the [official shap repo](https://github.com/shap/shap/tree/master/notebooks/image_examples)\n",
    "5. **Report Writing**\n",
    "* Document each step, from data preparation to explainability.\n",
    "* Include figures for model evaluation and SHAP analysis, and discuss their significance.\n",
    "* Address any challenges and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deliverables:\n",
    "* Code implementation in Google Colab.\n",
    "* Trained ResNet18 model.\n",
    "* Evaluation and explanation plots.\n",
    "* Comprehensive final report.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A presentation will be held 19/12."
